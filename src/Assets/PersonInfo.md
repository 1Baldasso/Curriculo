<summary><strong>CMCorp</strong> Backend Developer <small>08/22 - 02/23</small></summary>
I worked by creating queries using Linq to access the database and generate reports, perform calculations, and validate business rules. Throughout this process, I was responsible for ensuring that all relevant information was included in the reports, that the calculations were accurate, and that the business rules were being followed correctly. Additionally, I created test cases to run unit tests on the code prior to delivery. This step was essential to ensure the quality of the final product and prevent future issues. I worked closely with the testing team to conduct integration tests and identify possible inconsistencies, as well as hypotheses for solutions. Throughout the project, I maintained clear and constant communication with the team to ensure that all information was shared and activities were properly aligned. I also remained vigilant for possible process improvements and suggested ideas to optimize teamwork.
